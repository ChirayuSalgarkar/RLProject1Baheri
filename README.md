Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will explore and implement various reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to solve
the classic CartPole-v0 problem from OpenAI Gym. This environment presents a continuous state space

and a discrete action space, offering an excellent platform to compare tabular methods with function ap-
proximation techniques.
